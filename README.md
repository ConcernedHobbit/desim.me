Song lyrics are stored in the `songs/` directory.  
If you want to add a song, create a new file in the directory with the song lyrics in it.

You'll also need to add a header, containing at least a title for the song:

```
---
title: Song title
---

Song lyrics...
```

You can also specify the melody and/or writers:

```
---
title: Gurulassa
melody: Anssi Kela - Puistossa
writers: Ada
---

Gurulassa ilta viilenee.
Topi l채mpimikseen koodailee...
```

### Books (WIP)

Books can be added as JSON files in the `books` folder. See [`books/tekis-2017.json`](/books/tekis-2017.json) for reference.

Books can be linked using their filename, e.g. `tekis-2017.json` matches https://laulum.me/book/tekis-2017.

**Format**

```js
{
  "title": "Title of the book",
