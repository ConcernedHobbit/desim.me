Negroni, Manhattan and Tequila sunrise;
Gin Tonic, Blue Angel, a vodka with some ice;
Campari orange, Ferrari, Tom Collins;
these are a few of my favourite drinks!

Screwdriver, Grasshopper, Apple Martini;
Black russian, White russian! Long island ice tea;
Little green fairies absinthe on their wings;
These are a few of my favourite drinks!

When the glass breaks;
or my hand shakes;
when I'm feeling sad;
I mix up a few of my favourite drinks,
and then I don't feel so bad!
