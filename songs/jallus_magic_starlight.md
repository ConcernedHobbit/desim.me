melody: Täällä Pohjantähden alla

Under Jallu’s magic starlight
Not the highest star, but most bright
I look through my empty shot glass
And I fill it up again

Under Jallu’s magic starlight
Our strong drinks are cut from first bite
From this magic drink a shelter
I will make for my sad days

:,: And under Jallu’s starlight
I will take one for a safe flight
Only under Jallu’s soft sight
I will cry a joyful tear :,:

Under Jallu’s magic starlight,
Singer’s throat gets dry and so tight
Only getting booze he feels right
And can move on from this day

Under Jallu’s magic starlight
Creeps a frost my soul cannot fight
But by corking one more tonight
My heart’s chill is thawed away

:,: And under Jallu’s starlight
I will take one for a safe flight
Only under Jallu’s soft sight
I will cry a joyful tear :,:
